This is a small project made with my game engine at which I tried creating a basic version of wordle.

How to play:
You have 6 chances to guess the 5 letter word that is randomly generated.

Colour code:
Green - If the letter matches the letter in the same position of the generated word
Yellow - If the letter is contained in the word however is not in the correct position
Grey - The letter is not contained in the word
